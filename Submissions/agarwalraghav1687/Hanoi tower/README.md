# Tower of Hanoi

In this I have created a program for hanoi Tower.
The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical game or puzzle. 
It consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. 
The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.
